# Ravenous - The Restaurant Search App

## Overview

Ravenous is a React-based web application that leverages the Yelp API to allow users to search for restaurants in their area. It is designed to mirror the functionality of Yelp, providing search results based on user queries, sorting by best match, highest rated, or most reviewed options. This project is part of the Codecademy's Full-Stack Engineer curriculum, which guides learners through the process of building functional applications with front-end and back-end technologies.

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript (ES6)
- React.js
- Yelp API

## Project Objectives

- To create a dynamic, client-side application in React.
- To learn how to pass information to components and manage their state.
- To practice interacting with a third-party API and handle the data fetched.

## Project Structure

The project is divided into several stages:

1. **Creating Static Components**: Building out the static parts of the app.
2. **Passing Information to Components**: Implementing data flow between components.
3. **Setting the State of Components**: Making the app interactive by using state.
4. **Interacting with the Yelp API**: Fetching real data from Yelp and displaying it.

## Running the Project

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the necessary node modules with `npm install`.
3. Start the development server with `npm start`.
4. Visit `http://localhost:3000` in your browser to view the application.
